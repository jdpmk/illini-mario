# Final Project Proposal

## The Project

The project I want to make is a platformer game where a player has to jump upwards on randomly-generated platforms as the screen scrolls up. As the game progresses, the rate at which the screen scrolls up increases. The game ends if the player falls to or touches the bottom of the screen.

## Motivation

I think that this game will be fun to play if it is completed because it will become progressively harder the longer the player survives. I am also motivated to learn how to implement more advanced collision detection and physics models for controlling a player in a platformer game.

## Timeline

In the first week, I will have a menu screen with a play button that enters the main game loop. I will also have a player that can jump around static platforms with the proper collision detection and motion physics for gravity and friction. If the player touches the bottom of the screen, the game will reach its end state. At this point in development, the player and platforms will probably be graphically represented by simple shapes such as rectangles and circles.

In the second week, I will have an algorithm that randomly generates platforms for the game, adhering to constraints such as the maximum height that the player can jump. I will also have vertical screen-scrolling which increases in speed over time.

In the third week, I will implement better graphical representations for my player/platforms using image assets. I will also implement a scoring system, which will keep track of either the height that the player has reached or the time that the player has survived. I plan to add game music and sound effects as well.

If I have extra time to add some more features, I would add modifiers to the environment that make the game easier or harder to play, such as scrolling speed increase. I could also add functionality to store player scores in a local database or file.
